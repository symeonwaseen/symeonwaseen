Dr. Waseen has been teaching theory, composition, and piano at Black Hills State University since fall 2010.  His research of algorithmic music composition and generation has led to projects such as a species counterpoint generator and generative model of Olivier Messiaen’s *Mode de valeurs et d'intensités* in NyquistIDE.  This work has inspired an interest in further studying the relationship between music, mathematics, and computer science.
